# yourbones

> > **Warning** _Yourbones_ is still _Work In Progress_.

A companion library for writing applications on Tezos (in OCaml). The name is
arguably funny to anyone who speaks French. Indeed, `your bones` can be
translated as `tes os` in the language of **Moli√®re**, which sounds like
`tezos`... hence the giggle.
